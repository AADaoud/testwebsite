> The **cat** (_Felis catus_) is a [domestic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication "Domestication") [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species "Species") of small [carnivorous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivorous "Carnivorous") [mammal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal "Mammal"). It is the only domesticated species in the family [Felidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felidae "Felidae") and is often referred to as the **domestic cat** to distinguish it from the wild members of the family. A cat can either be a **house cat**, a **[farm cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_cat "Farm cat")** or a **[feral cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_cat "Feral cat")**; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill [rodents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent "Rodent"). About 60 [cat breeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_breeds "Cat breeds") are recognized by various [cat registries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_registries "Cat registries").
